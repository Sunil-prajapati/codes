// === functional scope ====

// const in temporal deadZone hosting
function a() {}
// ====== block scope =======
{
}

// ==== Global scope ====
var a = 10;
console.log(a);

// === Block scoped ====
// 1.we can get the value of let and const in the block scope
{
  var b = 3;
  let b = 4;
}

// console.log(b) // b is not defined

// ================ variabel Shadowing ==========

function test() {
  let a = "Hello";
  var b = "kar lo";

  if (true) {
    let a = "Hi";
    console.log(a);
    let b = "chak lo";
    console.log(b);
  }
  console.log(a);
  console.log(b);
}
test();

// ===== declartion of variable ==========
// 1. We can declare same variable but the scope should be different in case of LET and CONST
let z;
{
  let z;
}
// ======
// we need intialize for const any value before declaring
let d;
// const f;  //Missing initializer in const declaration

// temperal dead zone is in the scope but not declared

// =========  HOISTING =======
// NOTE: aCCESS BEFORE INTIALIZE

name();
console.log(x);

var x = 7; // if we use let then it will show cannot access before intialization

function name() {
  console.log("java script name ");
}

// it shows error because it works as another variable
var name = () => {
  console.log("java script name ");
};

// var can only be global and function scope it's all depends upload declaration
// var variables can be re-declared and updated
// var is function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that it is available and can be accessed only within that function.

// let is block scoped
// let can be updated but not re-declared.

// const declarations are block scoped
// const cannot be updated or re-declared
// only on object we can update the const

// var has function scope
// let and var are block scoped

// with the var we have a problem of updating the value in same address to  resolve this es6 introduce let const
// we can similar variable out side of the block
