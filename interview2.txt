1.difference bw state and useSate
    state is like any other variable like const name = "developer" in normal way
    but for react state is when we update it it should re-render the ui

2. how many hook do we have to update state
    useReducer
    useState

3. way to track the state changes
    useEffect with dependency array

4. why vite faster as compare webpack

   CRA(create react app): in webpack it serve bundle 
   vite: use es6 in development server in files not in bundle  in production it serves bundle

5. source map helps to see jsx,scss, tsx files
    we see those all file in dev tools with the help of source map as browser don't know about the jsx

6. hooks
    inbuilt hooks
    custom hooks
