• I created a marketing site designed to engage traffic with an intuitive UI, making it easy for users to access comprehensive information about the company's products. The site features an onboarding flow for creating business accounts, implemented using React Hook Form, Tailwind CSS, and Redux for state management.

• Image Optimization: Compressed images and used modern formats like WebP to reduce load times.
• Caching Strategies: Leveraged browser caching and service workers to improve load times for returning visitors.
• Minification: Minified CSS, JavaScript, and HTML files to reduce the size of resources.
• Critical CSS: Inlined critical CSS to ensure the initial render is as fast as possible.
