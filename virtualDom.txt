createRoot creates a DOM which helps to compare with the browser DOM 
IN VIRTUAL dom react have it's track of changes 
react use fibre algorithm to update virtual DOM 
key feature of fibre such as pause, abort and reuse  (important)
also gives priorities to the changes 


Reconciliation : The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed.
(virtual and react tree)
Diffing algorithm we use in Reconciliation

Although Fiber is a ground-up rewrite of the reconciler,

virtual dom : we have less prop (approx seven)
const h1_virtual = <h1>this is virtual dom element </h1>

real dom : we have a lot of properties 
const real_h1 = document.createElement("h1")
real_h1.innerText("This is real dom")

console.dir(real_h1)

every element is object 

we don't update the real dom on browser in react until we finalized the changes 

Qns: why we compare with virtual dom why not not with real dom 
Ans: because we have to compare very less properties of elements, in virtual we only have most 8 properties to compare but in real we have at least 150
