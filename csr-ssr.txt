CSR:
on build we have everything in bundle like html, css and js 
but on server we categorized all three things 
in that case on client browser we get html > css > js 
this also creates problems for seo because sometimes there is delay for some reason so we don't got anything on the page 
for some time

SSR:
Generate on each request
Rendering handle on the server side 
always create web page on sever on behalf of client side request 
in some condition user don't have RAM power so site load on server it shows them fast 

SSG: Generate on build time (static site generation)
create every different page 
all the stages are similar build, sever and client browser
