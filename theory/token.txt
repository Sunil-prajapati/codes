======= main points =========
secure way to store JWT 

store in httpOnly cookie 
and create only on backend 

because cannot access by javascript
serve app with express server
mirror frontend round inside server
frontend simply pings backend with data
cookie can created both side client and server as well but httpOnly cookie creates only on backend




Use cases affected by HttpOnly cookies
There are 5 major flows that are affected by this problem.

Login
Logout
Refresh
Authenticating API calls
and checking if the user session is expired or not
