Global execution context
this is divided into two parts:-
memory creation phase           code execution phase

variable store as undefined
function stored as whole 
function in this section 



POINTS =>
function has own scope as local with this keyword  (memory allocation phase code execution phase also in function scope)
let and const in script section
function is pure hosting because it already available in memory phase 


================
call stack 

first stack is Global(anonymous) stack
second can be function stack if any
call stack follow LIFO
once it get out from stack it got deleted 

function introduceMe(){
    console.log("in call stack")
    introduceMe() it will generate issue maximum call stack 
}
introduceMe()
